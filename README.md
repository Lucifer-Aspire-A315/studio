## Deployment Guide

Congratulations on building your app! Hereâ€™s how to deploy it and connect your custom domain from GoDaddy.

### Step 1: Deploy to Firebase

First, let's get your site live on its default Firebase URL.

1.  **Open the Terminal:** Open a new terminal in your editor.
2.  **Login to Firebase:** If you haven't already, log in to your Firebase account:
    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```
3.  **Deploy the App:** Run the following command to deploy your application to App Hosting:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only apphosting
    ```
4.  **Wait for Deployment:** The process will take a few minutes. Once it's complete, the terminal will give you a unique URL for your live site (e.g., `https://your-project-name--live-xxxxxxxx.web.app`). Visit this URL to see your deployed app!

### Step 2: Connect Your GoDaddy Domain

Now, let's connect your custom domain (e.g., `www.your-domain.com`).

1.  **Go to the Firebase Console:**
    *   Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Select your project.
    *   In the left-hand menu, go to **Build > App Hosting**.

2.  **Add Custom Domain:**
    *   Click the **"Add custom domain"** button.
    *   Enter the domain you own on GoDaddy (e.g., `www.your-domain.com`) and click "Continue".

3.  **Verify Ownership (TXT Record):**
    *   Firebase will provide you with a **TXT record** to verify that you own the domain. It will look something like `google-site-verification=...`.
    *   **Keep the Firebase page open** and open a new browser tab.
    *   Log in to your **GoDaddy** account.
    *   Navigate to your domain's **DNS Management** page.
    *   Add a new DNS record with the following details:
        *   **Type:** `TXT`
        *   **Name/Host:** `@` (or your domain name, depending on GoDaddy's interface)
        *   **Value:** Paste the verification code from Firebase.
        *   **TTL:** Leave as default (usually 1 hour).
    *   Save the record in GoDaddy.

4.  **Point Your Domain to Firebase (A Records):**
    *   Switch back to the Firebase Console tab and click **"Verify"**. This can take a few minutes to a few hours.
    *   Once verified, Firebase will show you two **IP addresses (A records)**.
    *   Go back to your **GoDaddy DNS Management** page.
    *   Add **two** new `A` records:
        *   **Record 1:**
            *   **Type:** `A`
            *   **Name/Host:** `@`
            *   **Value/Points to:** The first IP address from Firebase.
            *   **TTL:** Leave as default.
        *   **Record 2:**
            *   **Type:** `A`
            *   **Name/Host:** `@`
            *   **Value/Points to:** The second IP address from Firebase.
            *   **TTL:** Leave as default.
    *   Save these records in GoDaddy.

5.  **Finalize in Firebase:**
    *   Go back to the Firebase Console and click **"Finish"**.
    *   Firebase will now provision an SSL certificate for your domain. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours.

Once complete, your site will be live and secure at your custom GoDaddy domain!
